# In-Silico-Neuroscience
Includes weekly exercises for a PhD course

This repository contains weekly exercises/homeworks for one of the course I took as part of my PhD programme. The course In Silico Neuroscience aims to introduce students to a number of concepts, including:
    + how neuroscience data is acquired and organized
    + data-driven modeling and validation
    + simulation and analysis technologies
    
This work was done in a group, in collaboration with two other students undertaking the course. Some of the code was provided material.
